      <h1>haptic device for the visually impaired</h1>

      <h2>device specifications</h2>
      <p>The device is implemented as a wearable in the form of a hat.  It detects objects in the direct line of sight of the user.  It utilizes two motors placed on the left and right side of the hat such that they are lined up with the user's temples.  They pulse more rapidly the closer an object is, cutting off at a distance of under five inches from the user. Similarly, the two motors vibrate less frequently the further away the object is from the user, with the maximum distance set to fifteen feet.  An Arduino LilyPad was used as the microcontroller.  Distance reading came from one MaxSonar ultrasonic sensor located on the center on the brim of the hat facing forward.  The device is powered by a 2000mAh battery, which allows the user to wear it all day. An on/off switch located on the side of the hat toggles between turning the device on and charging the battery when a mini USB is connected to the charging port.</p>

      <h2>technical description of operation</h2>
      <p>When the user flips the switch, the device is powered by the battery.  The LilyPad runs the code, which has the following behavior based on object proximity (which can also be seen in the block diagram above):
        <p>For objects in the range of 180”-120”, the motors are on for 100ms and off for 900ms.
          For objects in the range of 120”-100”, the motors are on for 100ms and off for 800ms.
          For objects in the range of 100”-80”, the motors are on for 100ms and off for 700ms.
          For objects in the range of 80”-60”, the motors are on for 100ms and off for 600ms.
          For objects in the range of 60”-50”, the motors are on for 100ms and off for 500ms.
          For objects in the range of 50”-40”, the motors are on for 400ms and off for 400ms.
          For objects in the range of 40”-30”, the motors are on for 300ms and off for 300ms.
          For objects in the range of 30”-20”, the motors are on for 250ms and off for 250ms.
          For objects in the range of 20”-15”, the motors are on for 200ms and off for 200ms.
          For objects in the range of 15”-10”, the motors are on for 150ms and off for 150ms.
          For objects in the range of 10”-5”, the motors are on for 100ms and off for 100ms.</p>
